Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over

Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?
We don't really need to know
Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go

You were looking at me like you wanted to stay
When I saw you yesterday
I'm not wasting your time, I'm not playing no games
I see you

No one but you got me feeling this way
There's so much we can't explain
Maybe we're helping each other escape
I'm with you

Rockabye, don't bother cry
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky (Ah, Rockabye!)
Rockabye, don't bother cry (Yeah!)
Angels surround you, just dry your eye (Yeah, ah, rockabye!)
Rockabye, don't bother cry (No!)
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky (Oh, Rockabye!)

She works at nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (daily struggle)

So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Ah, Rockabye, no
