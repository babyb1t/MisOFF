[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I found a love
For me
Oh darling, just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well, I found a girl
Beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone
Waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Well, I found a man
Stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams
I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love
To carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children
Of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2: Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran & Both]
Well, baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
While listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3: Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran & Both]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
While listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel
In person
And she looks perfect
And he looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divide, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

[Chorus]
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Letra de ""Guerrera"" ft. Dellafuente[Estribillo: C. Tangana]
Ella, que ha nacido modelo, diva y superestrella
Deja el mundo menos bonito cuando se aleja
Riendo porque mi alma le llora y queja
(Es una guerrera)

[Verso 1: Dellafuente]
Ella tiene arsenal, ella, pa' cargarse a cualquiera
Le gusta viajar, ella, pega'ita a mi vera
Tiene el pedal, ella, cuando quiere acelera
Adicta a pelear, es una guerrera
(Eso es)

Lo juro, me muera
Es una guerrera
Lo juro, me muera
Lo juro, me muera

[Verso 2: Dellafuente & C. Tangana]
Ella roba en las tiendas
Atraca los bancos, se entera de to' los santos
Se sabe el nombre del jurado
Tiene fichados los horarios
Tiene una hacienda, tres o cuatro barcos
Un M4 y un Lambo
Tiene cuero y piel en el armario
Un nombre hecho por todo el barrio
Y ella cierra los ojos y ve
A través de las paredes
Tiene la fuerza de mil hombres
Y yo me pierdo en su timidez
Eso...

[Estribillo: C. Tangana & Dellafuente]
Ella, que ha nacido modelo, diva y superestrella
Deja el mundo menos bonito cuando se aleja
Riendo porque mi alma le llora y queja
Es una guerrera, ella
Lo juro, me muera, ella
Es una guerrera, ella
Lo juro, me muera, ella
Eso es

[Verso 3: Dellafuente]
Y el orgullo me robó
A punta de Kalashnikov
Y mi cerebro secuestró
Calla'ita con silenciador
Y ahora to'l mundo sabe:
Que tiene arsenal pa' cargarse a cualquiera
Le encanta viajar pega'íta a mi vera
Ella, tiene el pedal, y cuando quiere acelera
Adicta a pelear, es una guerrera
(Eso es)

[Outro: C. Tangana & Dellafuente]
Ella, lo juro, me muera
Ella, es una guerrera
Lo juro, me muera
Ella, lo juro, me muera...
